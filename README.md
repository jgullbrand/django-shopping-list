## Shopping List - Django App   

**Live app available on Heroku here: https://jgshoppinglist.herokuapp.com/**  

- I developed using Python (3.6.5) / Django (2.1.5)   
- For the design of the app, I used HTML/CSS files from W3schools.com as a base and then customized further    

With this app, you can make the following actions:   
- Add an item to your shopping list. 
- Click on an item to mark it as complete.  
- Delete a single item from the list.   
- Clear the entire list.
